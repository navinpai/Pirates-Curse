=========== PIRATE'S CURSE ===========
So, this guy who was supposed to be developing the app for the online treasure hunt at the techfest of my college (Goa Engineering College), Technix Six (http://gectechnix.in) decided to ditch the team at the last moment, leaving the event with absolutely no hopes.

Coded this as a makeshift treasure hunt application.

Entire code written in 2 hours flat (Yes, it's inefficient. Yes, it's Naive. But it works.)

Event works as follows:
1) Clues shown as images. Answer to each clue is a text string.
2) User may choose to skip a question and return to it later on.
3) If user answers and
		- Answer is correct
			Go to Next question
		- Answer is wrong
			Come back to same question
4) Admin can monitor status of the teams.
5) Also added an easter egg of a cheat code which when entered by any team, makes the team win instantly! :P
6) The design aspect of it is as minimal as possible, with barely 2-3 divs defined. Will probably improve this someday!

NOTE: All basic settings changable in 'var.php'
Import 'db.sql' into the database you are using. 
To change questions/answers, see the 'questions' table in the database.
To change users and their passwords, see 'users' table in database.
